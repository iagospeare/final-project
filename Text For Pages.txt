Remember to push yourself to do the moves not only as fast as you can, but also with good form. We recommend a 5 minute warm up and 5 minute cool down.  Warm up ideas include, but are not limited to a combination involving the following: jogging in place or on treadmill, jumping jacks, burpees, scissor runs, or stretching.  Cool downs are essential for your recovery.  This time helps your heart rate and breathing return to normal levels gradually which will help you avoid dizziness.  Cool downs should include 3-5 stretches each holding for 30 seconds 3 times.
