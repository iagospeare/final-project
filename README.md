# Project 6
### Ruby on Rails Project

###Instructions
-To run the application run 
"rake db:setup"
"rails server"


###How GetThat  works
-Users create a workout profile where they fill out a quiz with their biometric information as well as personal goals.

-Once they submit this page, a calendar is displayed and populated with a specific plan according to their start date (the day they created the account) AND according to their biometrics and information answered in the quiz.

-Users are encouraged to stick with the set days that've been prepoluated to encourage healthy muscle gain and to encourage rest days to avoid soreness. 

-Each calendar day is populated with the name of a specified workout.

-The workouts are explained in another page and you can navigate to it by clicking on the workout name in the calendar.

-The page that is rendered lists the time and number of rounds you are to do each specified workout. The times and rounds are unique to the user. Once they've finished their workouts, they are encouraged to review their workout on the "reviews" page where they can choose the workout they completed with their personal review anonymously. There is a link to this page below their workout.

-Users can go to the All Exercises page to watch videos and read descriptions explaining EACH move. The link to it is located in the Nav Bar.   

-Our site has been created to encourage new users who wish to stat working out and takes all the neccessary steps in educating them of the exercises they will be performing.  

###Issues
-For some pages it is neccessary to load twice, as the css/formatting doesn't always load the first time.  

-Sometimes the videos on the "Daily Workouts Explained" do not load.  What is to be displayed are embedded videos with each move!
